<!-- Table 2 that explains the Nav Bar -->
<section>
    <p> A really useful tool to avoid having to scroll down over a whole page is the nav bar. You probably use it all the time for convenience and this is a great way for humans to access information more quickly. They can be a little tricky and this is where we start to get into selectors, classes, and ids. There are also global selectors and inline selectors as well. </p>
